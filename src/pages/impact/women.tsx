              <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
                Behind every bright light of the Indian film industry, there are countless women fighting battles no one sees. From makeup artists and costume designers to junior artists and lead actresses, women across every department face daily exploitation, harassment, and discrimination. They are blackmailed, denied fair wages, falsely accused with FIRs, and forced to suffer in silence — because they have no one to stand for them.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
                Many leave their hometowns and families, dreaming of a career in cinema, but are trapped by powerful people who misuse their vulnerability. Their struggle isn’t just professional; it’s a battle for dignity, safety, and survival in an industry that often turns a blind eye.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
                We are here to change that.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
                We will fight for every woman’s right to work safely, earn fairly, and live with respect. From legal battles to workplace safety, from skill development to financial aid, and from mental health support to marriage assistance — we are committed to being their strength at every step.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
                Because their dreams are as important as anyone else’s. And no woman in this industry should ever feel alone again.
